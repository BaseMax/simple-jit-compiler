# Simple JIT Compiler

This project is designed to illustrate the mechanism used in **JIT** compilers development.

## Using

C++ via g++:

```
g++ jit.cpp -o jit-cpp
./jit-cpp
```

C via gcc:

```
gc jit.c -o jit-c
./jit-c
```

Note: This also works if you enable `-m32` flag on your compiler. (e.g: `gcc jit.c -o jit -m32`)

However, this has architectural limitations and does not works everywhere.
